{ TODO: 
	- Check new functions and the indefined functions if i need them 
	- Brain storm some new ideas bruh 
        - Check how to related the pascal code with .txt files 
	- Check for newbies resources to learn or may be you're own blog it might be a good idea ?
	- Read documentations about these, watch some tutorials and read some books

program toknow;
uses crt;
type 
tab1 = array[1..1000] of string;
tab2 = array[1..1000] of integer; 
var

Procedure  wduw (ch:string;);
var
	x,y : integer;
begin
       val(ch,k,e);
       if k=1  then
	     {import a text file realted to the option number 1}
	       
       else if k=2 then
	      {import a text file related to the option number 2}


end; 


begin
{ i need a good intro cause it needs to attract the user . see some GUI pascal related tutorials } 
{ Giving the order from the user  }
	repeat
	  writeln('donner une ordere: '); readln(ch); 
	until (ch in ['A'..'Z']);
